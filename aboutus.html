                        The present amalgamated company was formed subsequent to the acquisition of 49.7% stake in

                        Healthcare Institute Limited by Radiant Life Care Pvt. Ltd. ( “Radiant”) and the amalgamation of
                        Max
                        Healthcare with Radiant thereafter. The amalgamated entity assumed the name Max Healthcare
                        Institute
                        limited. Prior to the amalgamation, Radiant was led and promoted by Abhay Soi.
